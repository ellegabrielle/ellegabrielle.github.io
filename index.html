<h1>About ME</h1>
<p>Hey everyone! Okay so this is my portfolio where you can look at all the different art work I have done.<br>But first, who am I? Where do I begin? Okay so I am a junior at Grand View University, I play basketball,<br>I am involved in Dance Marathon, all that good stuff. I am also...you guessed it...a Graphic Designer! Woo!!!<br>Speaking of Graphic Design, I have learned to take my artsistic abilities to the next level; I never even knew<br>about software like Illustrator or Dreamweaver before college...I just knew that I wanted to let my creatvie<br>juices flow out into the world! So with that being said, go check out my work!</p>
