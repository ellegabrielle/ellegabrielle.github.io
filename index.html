	About Me
	<p>
	Hey everyone! Okay so this is my portfolio where you can look at all the different art work I have done. 
      But first, who am I? Where do I begin? Okay so I am a junior at Grand View University,
      I play basketball, I am involved in Dance Marathon, all that good stuff. 
      I am also...you guessed it...a Graphic Designer! Woo!!! Speaking of Graphic Design, I have learned
      to take my artsistic abilities to the next level; I never even knew about software like Illustrator
      or Dreamweaver before college...I just knew that I wanted to let my creatvie juices flow out into the world!
      So with that being said, go check out my work!
